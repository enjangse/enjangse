Passionate about IT technology, especially with Infrastructure, Cloud, Storage. Right now, most of my time spend on Cloud and deployment apps. 

beside spending my time for works, I spend my time with learn from some courses(it will be wasted my money, if I dont use it, right?) and writing in my personal blog. Please visit this, and see if you can find some interesting in my Blog. https://cloudtriburatary.wordpress.com.
